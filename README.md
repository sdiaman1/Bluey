Based on [Creating BLE GATT Server (UART Service) on Raspberry Pi](https://scribles.net/creating-ble-gatt-server-uart-service-on-raspberry-pi/). Version 1 of the [runme.py](https://github.com/sdiaman1/Bluey/commits/main/runme.py) in this repo is from there, and also Max's instructions are excellent, check them out!

# Getting Started

Copy the `.py` and `.txt` files from this repo to a folder on your Raspberry Pi and run the `runme.py` file.
